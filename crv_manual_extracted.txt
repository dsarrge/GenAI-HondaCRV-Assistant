Owner's Manual
2023 CR-V
California Proposition 65 Warning
WARNING: Operating, servicing
and maintaining a passenger vehicle
or off-highway motor vehicle can
expose you to chemicals including
engine exhaust, carbon monoxide,
phthalates, and lead, which are
known to the State of California to
cause cancer and birth defects or
other reproductive harm.
To minimize exposure, avoid
breathing exhaust, do not idle the
engine except as necessary, service
your vehicle in a well-ventilated area
and wear gloves or wash your hands
frequently when servicing your
vehicle. For more information go to
www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/passenger-
vehicle.
Event Data Recorders
This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR).
The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near
crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a
road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's
systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related
to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of
time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is
designed to record such data as:
· How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
· Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were
buckled/fastened;
. How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator
and/or brake pedal; and,
. How fast the vehicle was traveling.
These data can help provide a better understanding of the
circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data
are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation
occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving
conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and
crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law
enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of
personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash
investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required,
and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the
vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that
have the special equipment, can read the information if they have
access to the vehicle or the EDR.
The data belongs to the vehicle owner and may not be accessed by
anyone else except as legally required or with the permission of the
vehicle owner.
Service Diagnostic Recorders
This vehicle is equipped with service-related devices that record
information about powertrain performance. The data can be used
to verify emissions law requirements and/or help technicians
diagnose and solve service problems. It may also be combined with
data from other sources for research purposes, but it remains
confidential. Some diagnostic and maintenance information is
uploaded to Honda upon vehicle start up.
California Perchlorate Contamination Prevention Act
The airbags, seat belt tensioners, and CR type batteries in this
vehicle may contain perchlorate materials - special handling may
apply. See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate/
As you read this manual, you will find information that is preceded
by a NOTICE symbol. This information is intended to help you avoid
damage to your vehicle, other property, or the environment.
System Updates Terms and Conditions*
General
Your vehicle has an application that allows your 9-in. Color
Touchscreen to automatically search for Honda software updates
that are specific to your 9-in. Color Touchscreen and its connected
devices (initially every one (1) week via Wi-Fi or every four (4) weeks
via Telematics Control Unit (TCU)*, queries may occur more or less
frequently due to internet outages, retries, direct user action, WAP
push from the server or a change in query policy on the Honda
servers). This application periodically transmits to our servers a
limited amount of vehicle and device information (Vehicle
Identification Number (VIN), the Model Type (MT) Identification
Number, Hardware and Software Part Number, Serial Number,
Software Version, preferred language, Internet Protocol (IP)
address, Transaction Log (alert or update viewing, update
download and installation, software status), etc.). When the
application finds an update from the server, the application initially
asks permission to download and install the update. Where
available, in your settings menu you may elect to automatically
download and install these updates or you may elect to manually
update the system.
When your 9-in. Color Touchscreen searches our servers for
updates or alerts, we will automatically provide you with the
opportunity to update your devices or transmit the update or alert
directly to your 9-in. Color Touchscreen. We will also maintain on
our servers a log of the updates or alerts that are installed.
Your Personal Data
Should the aforementioned information transmitted to Honda
constitute personal information in your region, please note that this
information will be treated in strict accordance with the rules and
regulations outlined in this notice as well as applicable data
protection law.

from you or that you provide to us, via the application.
For further details, see Honda's connected product privacy policy at:
U.S .: www.honda.com
Canada: www.honda.ca/privacy/vehicledata
Honda collects, uses and stores your personal data for the reasons
set out below:
· to deliver the system updates and related services to you;
· to allow us to improve and optimize the system updates
products and services;

record keeping.
· where necessary for Honda's legitimate interests, as listed
below, and where our interests are not overridden by your data
protection rights.
Protecting our legitimate business interests and legal rights
includes, but is not limited to, use in connection with compliance,
regulatory, auditing, legal claims (including disclosure of such
information in connection with legal process or litigation) and other
ethics and compliance reporting requirements.
Honda will also convert personal data into anonymous data and
use it (normally on an aggregated statistical basis) for uses such as
market research and analysis, to improve the system updates, to
analyze trends, and to assess the success of software update
releases. Aggregated personal information does not personally
identify you or any other user of the system updates.
Honda may share this data with Honda's worldwide support
organization or affiliated Honda companies or other third parties
engaged by Honda for the purposes of rendering support services
in connection with system support.

For Safe Driving
The following pages explain your vehicle's safety features and how to use them
properly. The safety precautions below are ones that we consider to be among the
most important.
Safe Driving
Important Safety Precautions
Always wear your seat belt
A seat belt is your best protection in all types of collisions. Airbags are designed to
supplement seat belts, not replace them. So even though your vehicle is equipped
with airbags, make sure you and your passengers always wear your seat belts, and
wear them properly.
>Important Safety Precautions
Some states, provinces and territories prohibit the use
of cell phones other than hands-free devices by the
driver while driving.
Restrain all children
Children ages 12 and under should ride properly restrained in a back seat, not the
front seat. Infants and small children should be restrained in a child seat. Larger
children should use a booster seat and a lap/shoulder seat belt until they can use the
belt properly without a booster seat.
Be aware of airbag hazards
While airbags can save lives, they can cause serious or fatal injuries to occupants
who sit too close to them, or are not properly restrained. Infants, young children,
and short adults are at the greatest risk. Be sure to follow all instructions and
warnings in this manual.
Don't drink and drive
Alcohol and driving don't mix. Even one drink can reduce your ability to respond to
changing conditions, and your reaction time gets worse with every additional drink.
So don't drink and drive, and don't let your friends drink and drive, either.
38
D
For Safe Driving Important Safety Precautions
Pay appropriate attention to the task of driving safely
Engaging in cell phone conversation or other activities that keep you from paying
close attention to the road, other vehicles, and pedestrians could lead to a crash.
Remember, situations can change quickly, and only you can decide when it is safe to
divert some attention away from driving.
Safe Driving
Control your speed
Excessive speed is a major factor in crash injuries and deaths. Generally, the higher
the speed, the greater the risk, but serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds.
Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions, regardless of the maximum
speed posted.
Keep your vehicle in safe condition
Having a tire blowout or a mechanical failure can be extremely hazardous.
To reduce the possibility of such problems, check your tire pressures and condition
frequently, and perform all regularly scheduled maintenance.
Do not leave children unattended in the vehicle
Children, pets, and people needing assistance left unattended in the vehicle may be
injured if they activate one or more of the vehicle controls. They may also cause the
vehicle to move, resulting in a crash in which they and/or another person(s) can be
injured or killed. Also, depending on the ambient temperature, the temperature of
the interior may reach extreme levels, which can result in harm or death. Even if the
climate control system is on, never leave them in the vehicle unattended as the
climate control system can shut off at any time.
39
>For Safe Driving
>Important Handling Information
Important Handling Information
Your vehicle has higher ground clearance than a passenger vehicle designed for use
only on pavement. Higher ground clearance has many advantages for off-highway
driving. It allows you to travel over bumps, obstacles, and rough terrain. It also
provides good visibility so you can anticipate problems earlier.
Safe Driving
These advantages come at some cost. Because your vehicle is taller and rides higher
off the ground, it has a higher center gravity making it more susceptible to tipping
or rollover if you make abrupt turns. Utility vehicles have a significantly higher
rollover rate than other types of vehicles. In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is
significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt. As a reminder,
make sure you and your passengers always wear seat belts.

>Your Vehicle's Safety Features
Your vehicle is equipped with many features that
work together to help protect you and your
passengers during a crash.
Some features do not require any action on your part.
These include a strong steel framework that forms a
safety cage around the passenger compartment,
front and rear crush zones, a collapsible steering
column, and tensioners that tighten the front seat
belts in a sufficient crash.
Safe Driving
However, you and your passengers cannot take full
advantage of these features unless you remain seated
in the correct position and always wear your seat
belts. In fact, some safety features can contribute to
injuries if they are not used properly.

Safety Checklist
For the safety of you and your passengers, make a habit of checking these items
each time before you drive.
. After everyone has entered the vehicle, be sure all doors and the tailgate are
closed and locked. Locking the doors and the tailgate helps prevent an occupant
from being ejected and an outsider from unexpectedly opening a door or the
tailgate.

· Adjust your seat to a position suitable for driving. Be sure the front seats are
adjusted as far to the rear as possible while allowing the driver to control the
vehicle. Sitting too close to a front airbag can result in serious or fatal injury in a
crash.
Adjusting the Seat Positions P. 195
. Adjust head restraints to the proper position. Head restraints are most effective
when the center of the head restraint aligns with the center of your head. Taller

Seat Belts
About Your Seat Belts
Seat belts are the single most effective safety device because they keep you
connected to the vehicle so that you can take advantage of many built-in safety
features. They also help keep you from being thrown against the inside of the
vehicle, against any passengers, or out of the vehicle. When worn properly, seat
belts also keep your body properly positioned in a crash so that you can take full
advantage of the additional protection provided by the airbags.
In addition, seat belts help protect you in almost every type of crash, including:
- frontal impacts
- side impacts
- rear impacts
- rollovers
Lap/shoulder seat belts
All five seating positions are equipped with lap/shoulder seat belts with emergency
locking retractors. In normal driving, the retractor lets you move freely while keeping
some tension on the belt. During a collision or sudden stop, the retractor locks to
restrain your body.
The front passenger's and rear seat belts also have a lockable retractor for use with
child seats.
>Installing a Child Seat with a Lap/Shoulder Seat Belt P. 80
>About Your Seat Belts
WARNING
Not wearing a seat belt properly increases
the chance of serious injury or death in a
crash, even though your vehicle has
airbags.
Safe Driving
Be sure you and your passengers always
wear seat belts and wear them properly.
If you extend the seat belt too quickly, it will lock in
place. If this happens, slightly retract the seat belt,
then extend it slowly.
Seat belts cannot completely protect you in every
crash. But in most cases, seat belts can reduce your
risk of serious injury.
Most states and all Canadian provinces and territories
require you to wear seat belts.

Seat Belts About Your Seat Belts
Proper use of seat belts
Follow these guidelines for proper use:
Safe Driving
· All occupants should sit upright, well back in the seat, and remain in that position
for the duration of the trip. Slouching and leaning reduce the effectiveness of the
belt and can increase the chance of serious injury in a crash.
· Never place the shoulder part of a lap/shoulder seat belt under your arm or
behind your back. This could cause very serious injuries in a crash.
. Two people should never use the same seat belt. If they do, they could be very
seriously injured in a crash.
. Do not put any accessories on the seat belts. Devices intended to improve comfort
or reposition the shoulder part of a seat belt can reduce the protective capability
and increase the chance of serious injury in a crash.
44
>About Your Seat Belts
If a front or rear seat passenger moves around and
extends the seat belt, the lockable retractor may
activate. If this happens, release the retractor by
unfastening the seat belt and allow the belt to retract
completely. Then, refasten the belt.
Seat Belts About Your Seat Belts
Seat Belt Reminder
D
Front seats
The seat belt system includes an indicator on
the instrument panel to remind the driver or a
front passenger or both to fasten their seat
belts.
If the power mode is set to ON and a seat belt
is not fastened, a beeper will sound, and the
indicator will blink. After a few seconds, the
beeper will stop and the indicator will come
on and remain illuminated until the seat belt is
fastened.
The beeper will periodically sound and the
indicator will blink while the vehicle is moving
until the seat belt is fastened.
>Seat Belt Reminder
The indicator will also come on if a front passenger
does not fasten their seat belt within six seconds after
the power mode is set to ON.
When no one is sitting in the front passenger's seat,
the indicator will not come on and the beeper will not
sound.
Safe Driving
The indicator also may not come on and the beeper
may not sound when the occupant is not heavy
enough to trigger the weight sensor. Such occupants
(e.g., infants and smaller children) should be moved
to the rear seat as a deploying front airbag likely will
injure or kill them.
Protecting Child Passengers P. 73
The driver information interface uses colors to aid the
driver in checking the status of the passengers.
For the front seating positions:
· Green indicates the seat belt is fastened.
· An unfastened gray graphic indicates the seat belt
is not fastened and an occupant has not been
detected.
· An unfastened red graphic indicates the seat belt is
unfastened and an occupant has been detected.

Rear seats
Your vehicle monitors rear seat belt use.
A driver information interface notifies you if
any of the rear seat belts are unfastened after
they were previously fastened.
In order to encourage the driver to evaluate
rear seat belt usage, the display appears
when:
· Any of the rear passengers' seat belts are
unfastened when the power mode is
turned to ON.
. A rear door is opened and then closed.
· Any of the rear passengers fastens or
unfastens their seat belt.
The seat belt reminder indicator blinks and
beeper sounds if any rear passenger's seat belt
is unfastened while driving.
>Seat Belt Reminder
The system will not detect a passenger in the rear
seats who has not fastened the seat belt.
The driver should check the status of the rear
passengers' seat belts at the start of each trip and
each time a passenger is seated in the rear seats,
using the driver information interface as an aid.
An alert will sound if a passenger in the rear seats
unfastens the seat belt while the vehicle is in motion
or if motion resumes while the graphic is red.
The driver information interface uses colors to aid the
driver in checking the status of the passengers.
For the rear seating positions:
· Green indicates the seat belt is fastened.
· An unfastened gray graphic indicates the seat belt
has not been fastened recently.
· An unfastened red graphic indicates the seat belt
was unfastened recently.
The system does not monitor harnesses that are part
of a child seat, the anchors of the LATCH system, or
the anchor buckle of the rear center seat belt.
While the system can inform you that a seat belt
buckle is fastened, it cannot determine whether the
rear center seat belt anchor buckle is in use or if a
child seat is properly installed or used.

Seat Belts About Your Seat Belts
Automatic Seat Belt Tensioners
The front seats and the outer rear seats are equipped with automatic seat belt
tensioners to enhance safety.
The tensioners automatically tighten the front seat belts and the outer rear seat belts
during a moderate-to-severe frontal collision, sometimes even if the collision is not
severe enough to inflate the front airbags or the front knee airbag.

3. Position the lap part of the belt as low as
possible across your hips, then pull up on
the shoulder part of the belt so the lap part
fits snugly. This lets your strong pelvic
bones take the force of a crash and reduces
the chance of internal injuries.
4. If necessary, pull up on the belt again to
remove any slack, then check that the belt
rests across the center of your chest and
over your shoulder. This spreads the forces
of a crash over the strongest bones in your
upper body.
Adjusting the Shoulder Anchor
The front seats have adjustable shoulder anchors to accommodate taller and shorter
occupants.
1. Move the anchor up and down while
pulling the shoulder anchor outward.
2. Position the anchor so that the belt rests

Advice for Pregnant Women
If you are pregnant, the best way to protect yourself and your unborn child when
driving or riding in a vehicle is to always wear a seat belt and keep the lap part of the
belt as low as possible across the hips.
Wear the shoulder belt
across the chest avoiding
the abdomen.
Wear the lap part of the
belt as low as possible
across the hips.
Advice for Pregnant Women
Each time you have a checkup, ask your doctor if it is
okay for you to drive.
To reduce the risk of injuries to both you and your
unborn child that can be caused by an inflating front
airbag:
· When driving, sit upright and adjust the seat as far
back as possible while allowing full control of the
vehicle.
· When sitting in the front passenger's seat, adjust
the seat as far back as possible.

Seat Belts Seat Belt Inspection
Seat Belt Inspection
Regularly check the condition of your seat belts as follows:
. Pull each belt out fully, and look for frays, cuts, burns, and wear.
· Check that the latch plates and buckles work smoothly, and the belts retract
easily.
Safe Driving
If a belt does not retract easily, cleaning the belt may correct the problem. Only
use a mild soap and warm water. Do not use bleach or cleaning solvents. Make
sure the belt is completely dry before allowing it to retract.
Any belt that is not in good condition or working properly will not provide proper
protection and should be replaced as soon as possible.
A belt that has been worn during a crash may not provide the same level of
protection in a subsequent crash. Have your seat belts inspected by a dealer after
any collision.

Airbags Airbag System Components
The front, driver's knee, front passenger's
knee, side, and side curtain airbags are
deployed according to the direction and
severity of impact. Both side curtain airbags
are deployed in a rollover. The airbag
system includes:
Safe Driving
1 Two SRS (Supplemental Restraint System)
front airbags. The driver's airbag is stored
in the center of the steering wheel; the
front passenger's airbag is stored in the
dashboard. Both are marked SRS
AIRBAG.
2 Two knee airbags. The driver's knee
airbag is stored under the steering
column; the front passenger's knee
airbag is stored under the glove box.
Both are marked SRS AIRBAG.
3 Four side airbags, one for the driver, one
for the front passenger and two for the
rear outboard. The airbags are stored in
the outer edges of the seat-backs. All are
marked SIDE AIRBAG.
54
4 Two side curtain airbags, one for each
side of the vehicle. The airbags are stored
in the ceiling, above the side windows.
The front and rear pillars are marked
SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAG.
5 An electronic control unit that, when the
power mode is in ON, continually
monitors information about the various
impact sensors, seat and buckle sensors,
rollover sensor, airbag activators, seat
belt tensioners, and other vehicle
information. During a crash event the
unit can record such information.
6 Automatic seat belt tensioners for the
front seats and outer rear seats. In
addition, the driver's and front
passenger's seat belt buckles incorporate
sensors that detect whether or not the
belts are fastened.
7 Driver's seat position sensor. This sensor
detects the driver's seat slide position to
help determine the optimal deployment
of the driver's airbag.
8 Weight sensors in the front passenger's
seat. The sensors are used for occupant
classification to activate or deactivate the
front passenger's airbag.
9 Impact sensors that can detect a
moderate-to-severe front or side impact.
10 An indicator on the console panel that
alerts you that the front passenger's front
airbag has been turned off.
11 An indicator on the instrument panel that
alerts you to a possible problem with your

Important Facts About Your Airbags
Airbags can pose serious hazards. To do their job, airbags must inflate with
tremendous force. So, while airbags help save lives, they can cause burns, bruises,
and other minor injuries, sometimes even fatal ones if occupants are not wearing
their seat belts properly and sitting correctly.
What you should do: Always wear your seat belt properly and sit upright and as
far back from the steering wheel as possible while allowing full control of the
vehicle. A front passenger should move their seat as far back from the dashboard as
possible.
Remember, however, that no safety system can prevent all injuries or deaths that
can occur in a severe crash, even when seat belts are properly worn and the airbags
deploy.
Do not place hard or sharp objects between yourself and a front airbag.
Carrying hard or sharp objects on your lap, or driving with a pipe or other sharp
object in your mouth, can result in injuries if your front airbag inflates.
Do not attach or place objects on the front, driver's knee and front
passenger's knee airbag covers. Objects on the covers marked SRS AIRBAG
could interfere with the proper operation of the airbags or be propelled inside the
vehicle and hurt someone if the airbags inflate.
Important Facts About Your Airbags
Do not attempt to deactivate your airbags. Together,
airbags and seat belts provide the best protection.
When driving, keep hands and arms out of the
deployment path of the front airbag by holding each
side of the steering wheel. Do not cross an arm over
the airbag cover.

Airbags Types of Airbags
Types of Airbags
Your vehicle is equipped with four types of airbags:
· Front airbags: Airbags in front of the driver's and front passenger's seats.
· Knee airbags: Airbags under the steering column and under the glove box.
· Side airbags: Airbags in the driver's, front passenger's, and rear outer
passenger's seat-backs.
Safe Driving
· Side curtain airbags: Airbags above the side windows.
Each is discussed in the following pages.
Front Airbags (SRS)
The front SRS airbags inflate in a moderate-to-severe frontal collision to help protect
the head and chest of the driver and/or front passenger.
SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) indicates that the airbags are designed to
supplement seat belts, not replace them. Seat belts are the occupant's primary
restraint system.
Housing Locations
The front airbags are housed in the center of the steering wheel for the driver, and
in the dashboard for the front passenger. Both airbags are marked SRS AIRBAG.
56
>Types of Airbags
The airbags can inflate whenever the power mode is
in ON.
After an airbag inflates in a crash, you may see a
small amount of smoke. This is from the combustion
process of the inflator material and is not harmful.
People with respiratory problems may experience
some temporary discomfort. If this occurs, get out of
the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so.
Front Airbags (SRS)
During a frontal crash severe enough to cause one or
both front airbags to deploy, the airbags can inflate
at different rates, depending on the severity of the
crash, whether or not the seat belts are latched, and/
or other factors. Frontal airbags are designed to
supplement the seat belts to help reduce the
likelihood of head and chest injuries in frontal
crashes.
Airbags Front Airbags (SRS)
Operation
Front airbags are designed to inflate during moderate-to-severe frontal collisions.
When the vehicle decelerates suddenly, the sensors send information to the control
unit which signals one or both front airbags to inflate.
Safe Driving
A frontal collision can be either head-on or angled between two vehicles, or when a
vehicle crashes into a stationary object, such as a concrete wall.
How the Front Airbags Work
While your seat belt restrains your torso, the
front airbag provides supplemental protection
for your head and chest.
The front airbags deflate immediately so that
they won't interfere with the driver's visibility
or the ability to steer or operate other
controls.
The total time for inflation and deflation is so fast that most occupants are not
aware that the airbags deployed until they see them lying in front of them.
>How the Front Airbags Work
Although the driver's and front passenger's airbags
normally inflate within a split second of each other, it
is possible for only one airbag to deploy. This can
happen if the severity of a collision is at the margin,
or threshold that determines whether or not the
airbags will deploy. In such cases, the seat belt will
provide sufficient protection, and the supplemental
protection offered by the airbag would be minimal.
Continued
57
Airbags Front Airbags (SRS)
When front airbags should not deploy
Minor frontal crashes: Front airbags were designed to supplement seat belts and
help save lives, not to prevent minor scrapes, or even broken bones that might occur
during a less than moderate-to-severe frontal crash.
Side impacts: Front airbags can provide protection when a sudden deceleration
causes a driver or front passenger to move toward the front of the vehicle. Side
airbags and side curtain airbags have been specifically designed to help reduce the
severity of injuries that can occur during a moderate-to-severe side impact which
can cause the driver or passenger to move toward the side of the vehicle.
Rear impacts: Head restraints and seat belts are your best protection during a rear
impact. Front airbags cannot provide any significant protection and are not designed
to deploy in such collisions.
Safe Driving
Rollovers: In a rollover, your best form of protection is a seat belt or, if your vehicle
is equipped with a rollover sensor, both a seat belt and a side curtain airbag. Front
airbags, however, are not designed to deploy in a rollover as they would provide
little if any protection.
When front airbags deploy with little or no visible damage
Because the airbag system senses sudden deceleration, a strong impact to the
vehicle framework or suspension might cause one or more of the airbags to deploy.
Examples include running into a curb, the edge of a hole, or other low fixed object
that causes a sudden deceleration in the vehicle chassis. Since the impact is
underneath the vehicle, damage may not be readily apparent.
When front airbags may not deploy, even though exterior damage
appears severe
Since crushable body parts absorb crash energy during an impact, the amount of
visible damage does not always indicate proper airbag operation. In fact, some
collisions can result in severe damage but no airbag deployment because the airbags
would not have been needed or would not have provided protection even if they
had deployed.
58
Airbags Front Airbags (SRS)
Safe Driving
Advanced Airbags
The airbags have advanced features to help reduce the likelihood of airbag related
injuries to smaller occupants.
The driver's advanced airbag system includes a
seat position sensor.
Passenger's Seat
Weight Sensors
Driver's
Seat
Position
Sensor
Based on information from this sensor and the
severity of the impact, the advanced airbag
system determines the optimal deployment of
the driver's airbag.
The front passenger's advanced airbag system
has weight sensors. The sensors are used for
occupant classification to activate or
deactivate the front passenger's airbag.
For adult size occupants, the system will
automatically activate the front passenger's
airbag. If a small adult sits in the front
passenger seat and the system does not
recognize him/her as an adult, see
> Passenger Airbag Off Indicator P. 70
>Advanced Airbags
If there is a problem with the driver's seat position
sensor or the passenger's seat weight sensors, the
SRS indicator will come on, and in the event of a
crash, the airbag will deploy (regardless of the driver's
seating position or passenger's occupant
classification) with a force corresponding to the
severity of the impact.
> Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
Indicator P. 69
For the advanced front airbags to work properly,
confirm that:
· The occupant is sitting in an upright position,
wearing the seat belt properly and the seat-back is
not excessively reclined.
. The occupant is not leaning against the door or
center console.
. The occupant's feet are placed on the floor in front
of them.
. There are no objects hanging from the front
passenger's seat.
· Only small, lightweight objects are in the seat-back
pocket.
· The steering wheel and passenger's side dashboard
are not obstructed by any object.
. No liquid has been spilled on or under the seat.
· There is no child seat or other object pressing
against the rear of the seat or seat-back.
· There is no rear passenger pushing or pulling on
the back of the front passenger's seat.

Airbags Side Airbags
When a side airbag deploys with little or no visible damage
Because the airbag system senses sudden acceleration, a strong impact to the side
of the vehicle's framework can cause a side airbag to deploy. In such cases, there
may be little or no damage, but the side impact sensors detected a severe enough
impact to deploy the airbag.
Safe Driving
When a side airbag may not deploy, even though visible damage appears
severe
It is possible for a side airbag not to deploy during an impact that results in
apparently severe damage. This can occur when the point of impact was toward the
far front or rear of the vehicle, or when the vehicle's crushable body parts absorbed
most of the crash energy. In either case, the side airbag would not have been
needed nor provided protection even if it had deployed.
66
Airbags Side Curtain Airbags
Side Curtain Airbags
The side curtain airbags help protect the heads of the driver and passengers in the
outer seating positions during a moderate-to-severe side impact. The side curtain
airbags equipped in this vehicle are also designed to help reduce the likelihood of
partial and complete ejection of vehicle occupants through side windows in crashes,
particularly rollover crashes.
Housing Locations
The side curtain airbags are located in the
ceiling above the side windows on both sides
of the vehicle.
Side Curtain Airbag Storage
>Side Curtain Airbags
To get the best protection from the side curtain
airbags, occupants should wear their seat belts
properly and sit upright and well back in their seats.
Do not attach any objects to the side windows or roof
pillars as they can interfere with the proper operation
of the side curtain airbags.
Safe Driving
If the impact is on the passenger's side, the
passenger's side curtain airbag deploys even if there
are no occupants on that side of the vehicle.
If the SRS control unit senses that your vehicle is
about to rollover, it immediately deploys both side
curtain airbags and activates the seat belt tensioners
for the front seats and outer rear seats.

Child Safety
Protecting Child Passengers
Each year, many children are injured or killed in vehicle crashes because they are
either unrestrained or not properly restrained. In fact, vehicle crashes are the
number one cause of death of children ages 12 and under.
To reduce the number of child deaths and injuries, every state, Canadian province
and territory requires that infants and children be properly restrained when they ride
in a vehicle.
Children should sit properly restrained in a rear seat. This is because:
· An inflating front airbag can injure or kill a
child sitting in the front seat.
. A child in the front seat is more likely to
interfere with the driver's ability to safely
control the vehicle.
· Statistics show that children of all sizes and
ages are safer when they are properly
restrained in a rear seat.
Protecting Child Passengers
WARNING
Children who are unrestrained or
improperly restrained can be seriously
injured or killed in a crash.
Safe Driving
Any child too small for a seat belt should be
properly restrained in a child seat. A larger
child should be properly restrained with a
seat belt, using a booster seat if necessary.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
and Transport Canada recommend that all children
ages 12 and under be properly restrained in a rear
seat. Some states or provinces/territories have laws
restricting where children may ride.

Child Safety Protecting Child Passengers
. Never hold a child on your lap because it is impossible to protect them in the
event of a collision.
. Never put a seat belt over yourself and a child. During a crash, the belt would
likely press deep into the child and cause serious or fatal injuries.
Safe Driving
· Never let two children use the same seat belt. Both children could be very
seriously injured in a crash.
. Any child who is too small to wear a seat belt correctly must be restrained in an
approved child seat that is properly secured to the vehicle using either the seat
belt or the lower anchors of the LATCH system.
· Do not allow children to operate the doors, windows, or seat adjustments.
. Do not leave children in the vehicle unattended, especially in hot weather when
the inside of the vehicle can get hot enough to kill them. They could also activate
vehicle controls causing it to move unexpectedly.

>Child Safety Safety of Infants and Small Children
Selecting a Child Seat
Most child seats are LATCH-compatible (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children).
Some have a rigid-type connector while others have a flexible-type connector. Both
are equally easy to use. Some existing and previously owned child seats can only be
installed using the seat belt. Whichever type you choose, follow the child seat
manufacturer's use and care instructions including recommended expiration dates
as well as the instructions in this manual. Proper installation is key to maximizing
your child's safety.
In seating positions and vehicles not equipped with LATCH, a LATCH-compatible
child seat can be installed using the seat belt and a top tether for added security.
This is because all child seats are required to be designed so that they can be secured
with a lap belt or the lap part of a lap/shoulder belt. In addition, the child seat
manufacturer may advise that a seat belt be used to attach a LATCH-compatible seat
once a child reaches a specified weight. Please read the child seat owner's manual
for proper installation instructions.
Important consideration when selecting a child seat
Make sure the child seat meets the following three requirements:
. The child seat is the correct type and size for the child.
. The child seat is the correct type for the seating position.
. The child seat is compliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or
Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213.

Installing a LATCH-Compatible Child Seat
WARNING
Using the outer rear seats' inner anchors to
secure a LATCH-compatible child seat in the
center seating position may result in failure
of the child seat, causing injury or death.
Only use the outer rear seats' inner anchors
to install a child seat in the center seating
position if the manufacturer's instructions
expressly permit.
Installing a LATCH-compatible child seat in the
rear center seat
Each outer rear seat is equipped with a pair of lower
anchors which are used to secure a LATCH-
compatible child seat. The rear center seat, however,
is not equipped with anchors of any kind.
The inner and outer anchors are spaced apart at a
standard distance of 11 inches (280 mm). The distance
between the two inner anchors is 17 inches (432.6 mm).
LATCH-compatible restraint systems that are fitted
with rigid-type attachments cannot be installed in the
rear center seat. However, a system fitted with
flexible-type attachments can be installed in the
center seat, provided that the manufacturer's
instructions for that system permit the use of the
inner anchors with the stated spacing.
Before seating a child, make sure that the system is
properly attached to both the lower anchors and
tether anchors.

Installing a Child Seat with a Lap/Shoulder Seat Belt
A child seat can be installed with a lap/shoulder belt in any rear seat or, if absolutely
necessary, the front passenger seat.

≥Installing a Child Seat with a Lap/Shoulder Seat Belt
A child seat that is not properly secured will not
adequately protect a child in a crash and may cause
injury to the child or other vehicle occupants.
1. Make sure to lock the seat-back in the
upright position.
2. Place the child seat on the vehicle seat.
3. Route the seat belt through the child seat
according to the seat manufacturer's
instructions, and insert the latch plate into
the buckle.
Insert the latch plate fully until it clicks.
4. Slowly pull the shoulder part of the belt all
the way out until it stops. This activates the
lockable retractor.
5. Let the seat belt retract a few inches and
check that the retractor has switched
modes by pulling on the webbing. It should
not pull out again until it is reset by
removing the latch plate from the buckle.
If you are able to pull the shoulder belt
out, the lockable retractor is not
activated. Slowly pull the seat belt all the
way out, and repeat steps 4 - 5.
Safe Driving
Child SafetySafety of Infants and Small Children
6. Grab the shoulder part of the seat belt near
the buckle, and pull up to remove any slack
from the lap part of the belt.
When doing this, place your weight on
the child seat and push it into the vehicle
seat.
7. Make sure the child seat is firmly secured by
rocking it forward and back and side to
side; less than one inch of movement
should occur near the seat belt.

8. Make sure any unused seat belt that a child
can reach is buckled, the lockable retractor
is activated, and the belt is fully retracted
and locked.

If you have a child seat that comes with a
tether but can be installed with a seat belt, the
tether may be used for additional security.
Using an outer anchor
1. Raise the head restraint to its highest

Child Safety Safety of Larger Children
Safety of Larger Children
Protecting Larger Children
The following pages give instructions on how to check proper seat belt fit, what kind
of booster seat to use if one is needed, and important precautions for a child who
must sit in front.
Safe Driving
Checking Seat Belt Fit
When a child is too big for a child seat, secure the child in a rear seat using the lap/
shoulder seat belt. Have the child sit upright and all the way back, then answer the
following questions.
Checklist
. Do the child's knees bend comfortably over
the edge of the seat?
. Does the shoulder belt cross between the
child's neck and arm?
· Is the lap part of the seat belt as low as
possible, touching the child's thighs?
. Will the child be able to stay seated like this
for the whole trip?
If you answer yes to all these questions, the child is ready to wear the lap/shoulder
seat belt correctly. If you answer no to any question, the child needs to ride on a
booster seat until the seat belt fits properly without a booster seat.
84
>Safety of Larger Children
AWARNING
Allowing a child age 12 or under to sit in
front can result in injury or death if the
passenger's front airbag inflates.
If a larger child must ride in front, move the
vehicle seat as far to the rear as possible,
have the child sit up properly and wear the
seat belt properly, using a booster seat if
needed.
Child Safety Safety of Larger Children
Booster Seats
If a lap/shoulder seat belt cannot be used
properly, position the child in a booster seat in
the rear seat. For the child's safety, check that
the child meets the booster seat
manufacturer's recommendations.
Protecting Larger Children-Final Checks
Your vehicle has a rear seat where children can be properly restrained. If you ever
have to carry a group of children, and a child must ride in front:
. Make sure you read and fully understand the instructions and safety information
in this manual.
· Move the front passenger seat as far back as possible.
· Have the child sit upright and well back in the seat.
. Check that the seat belt is properly positioned so that the child is secure in the
seat.
Monitoring child passengers
We strongly recommend that you keep an eye on child passengers. Even older, more
mature children sometimes need to be reminded to fasten their seat belts and sit up
properly.
>Booster Seats
When installing a booster seat, make sure to read the
instructions that came with it, and install the seat
accordingly.
There are high- and low-type booster seats. Choose a
booster seat that allows the child to wear the seat
belt correctly.
Safe Driving
Some U.S. states, and Canadian provinces and
territories require children to use a booster seat until
they reach a given age or weight (e.g. 6 years or 60
lbs). Be sure to check current laws in the state or
province, or territory where you intend to drive.
85
Exhaust Gas Hazard
Carbon Monoxide Gas
The engine exhaust from this vehicle contains carbon monoxide, a colorless,
odorless, and highly toxic gas. As long as you properly maintain your vehicle, carbon
monoxide gas will not get into the interior.
Have the exhaust system inspected for leaks whenever
Safe Driving
· The exhaust system is making an unusual noise.
· The exhaust system may have been damaged.
· The vehicle is raised for an oil change.
When you operate a vehicle with the tailgate open, airflow can pull exhaust gas into
the interior and create a hazardous condition. If you must drive with the tailgate
open, open all the windows and set the climate control system as shown below.
1. Select the fresh air mode.
2. Select the
mode.
3. Set the fan speed to high.
4. Set the temperature control to a comfortable setting.
Adjust the climate control system in the same manner if you sit in your parked
vehicle with the engine running.
86
>>Carbon Monoxide Gas
AWARNING
Carbon monoxide gas is toxic.
Breathing it can cause unconsciousness and
even kill you.
Avoid any enclosed areas or activities that
expose you to carbon monoxide.
An enclosed area such as a garage can quickly fill up
with carbon monoxide gas.
Do not run the engine with the garage door closed.
Even when the garage door is open, drive out of the
garage immediately after starting the engine.

Seats Maintain a Proper Sitting Position
Maintain a Proper Sitting Position
After all occupants have adjusted their seats and head restraints, and put on their
seat belts, it is very important that they continue to sit upright, well back in their
seats, with their feet on the floor, until the vehicle is safely parked and the engine is
off
Sitting improperly can increase the chance of injury during a crash. For example, if
an occupant slouches, lies down, turns sideways, sits forward, leans forward or
sideways, or puts one or both feet up, the chance of injury during a crash is greatly
increased.
Controls
In addition, an occupant who is out of position in the front seat can be seriously or
fatally injured in a crash by striking interior parts of the vehicle or being struck by an
inflating front airbag.

occasionally make recommendations based on your learned preferences.

Features
D. SOFTWARE Operational Notices and Warnings
1. Vehicle Geolocation Information. You acknowledge that your VEHICLE may be equipped with certain traffic and map features. The
traffic feature will automatically collect and transmit, through GPS technology, your Vehicle's current location (longitude and latitude),
travel direction and speed ("VEHICLE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION") to HONDA and PROVIDERS. The VEHICLE GEOLOCATION
INFORMATION is used by HONDA and PROVIDERS to provide traffic and navigation-related information to you, but may also be used to
provide other SERVICES or offers to you. HONDA will not use such VEHICLE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION for its own marketing efforts,
or provide such information to unaffiliated third parties for their own purposes, without your express consent.
Continued 339
General Information on the Audio System Honda App License Agreement
2. Potential Map Inaccuracy and Route Safety. Maps used by this system may be inaccurate because of changes in roads, traffic controls,
routing, or driving conditions. Always use good judgment and common sense when following suggested routes. Do not follow the route
suggestions if doing so would result in an unsafe or illegal driving maneuver, if you would be placed in an unsafe situation, or if you would
be directed into an area that you consider unsafe. Do not rely on any navigation features included in the system to route you to emergency
services. Not all emergency services such as police, fire stations, hospitals, or clinics are likely to be contained in the map database for such
navigation features. Ask local authorities or an emergency services operator for such locations and routes. The driver is ultimately
responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and therefore, must evaluate whether it is safe to follow the suggested directions. Any
navigation features are provided only as an aid. Make your driving decisions based on your observations of local conditions and existing
traffic regulations. Navigation features are not a substitute for your personal judgment. Any route suggestions made by the SOFTWARE or
SERVICES should never replace any local traffic regulations or your personal judgment or knowledge of safe driving practices.
Features
3. Speech Recognition: You acknowledge and understand that HONDA and PROVIDERS may record, retain, and use voices commands
when you use the speech recognition components of the SOFTWARE or SERVICES. You and all VEHICLE operators and passengers (a)
consent to the recording and retention of voice commands in support of providing speech recognition components and (b) release HONDA
and PROVIDERS from all claims, liabilities, and losses that may result from any use of such recorded voice commands. Recognition errors
are inherent in speech recognition. It is your responsibility to monitor any speech recognition functions included in the system and address
any errors. Neither HONDA nor PROVIDERS will be liable for any damages arising out of errors in the speech recognition process.
4. Distraction Hazards. Navigation features may require manual (non-verbal) input or setup. Attempting to perform such set-up or insert
data while driving can seriously distract your attention and could cause a crash or other serious consequences; the ability to undertake such
interactions may also be limited by state or local law, which laws you are responsible to know and follow. Even occasional short scans of
the screen may be hazardous if your attention has been diverted away from your driving at a critical time. Pull over and stop the vehicle in
a safe and legal manner before attempting to access a function of the system requiring prolonged attention. Do not raise the volume
excessively. Keep the volume at a level where you can still hear outside traffic and emergency signals while driving. Driving while unable
to hear these sounds could result in a crash.

of time necessary to fulfill these goals.
(b) VEHICLE Geolocation Data (non-navigation/map based). If you opt-in to geolocation-based SERVICES, your vehicle's geolocation data
(latitude and longitude) will be automatically sent from your VEHICLE to HONDA and PROVIDERS.
(c) You understand that the inputting or uploading of information to your VEHICLE's multimedia system or the SOFTWARE or SERVICES is
at your own risk and that HONDA is not responsible for unauthorized access to or use of any personal or other information. All information

connection with the SOFTWARE or SERVICES, including, but not limited to claims for personal injury or property damage arising from the

strict products liability, Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations, bad faith, or breach of warranty of us or the malfunction of the SOFTWARE
or SOFTWARE SERVICES. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM FOR DAMAGES OTHER THAN
DIRECT, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AS LIMITED IN THIS AGREEMENT. YOU HEREBY RELEASE AND DISCHARGE HONDA AND ITS
LICENSORS AND CONTRACTORS (INCLUDING ANY THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING ALL OR PART OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES) FROM AND

This figure includes the total weight of all occupants, cargo, and
accessories, and the tongue load if you are towing a trailer.
Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit -
(1) Locate the statement "The combined weight of occupants and
cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs." on your
vehicle's placard.
(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers
that will be riding in your vehicle.
(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers
from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity. For example, if the "XXX" amount
equals 1,400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb. passengers in
your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load
capacity is 650 lbs. (1,400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)

Towing a Trailer
Towing Preparation
Towing Load Limits
Your vehicle can tow a trailer if you carefully observe the load limits, use the proper
equipment, and follow the towing guidelines. Check the load limits before driving.
Total trailer weight
Maximum allowable weight of the trailer,
cargo, and everything in or on it must not
exceed 1,500 lbs (680 kg). Towing loads in
excess of this can seriously affect vehicle
handling and performance and can damage
the engine and drivetrain.
Total Load
Tongue Load
Tongue load
The weight of the tongue with a fully loaded
trailer on the hitch should be approximately
10% of the total trailer weight.
· Excessive tongue load reduces front tire
traction and steering control. Too little
tongue load can make the trailer unstable
and cause it to sway.
· To achieve a proper tongue load, start by
loading 60% of the load toward the front
of the trailer and 40% toward the rear.
Readjust the load as needed.
>Towing Load Limits
WARNING
Exceeding any load limit or improperly
loading your vehicle and trailer can cause a
crash in which you can be seriously hurt or
killed.
Check the loading of your vehicle and
trailer carefully before starting to drive.
Check if all loads are within limits at a public scale.
If a public scale is not available, add the estimated
weight of your cargo load to the weight of your
trailer (as quoted by the manufacturer), and the
tongue load.
Driving
Break-in Period.
Avoid towing a trailer during your vehicle's first 600
miles (1,000 km).
Never exceed the gross weight ratings.

`Towing a Trailer Towing Preparation
Towing Equipment and Accessories
Towing equipment varies by the size of your trailer, how much load you are towing,
and where you are towing.
Hitches
The hitch must be of an approved type and properly bolted to the underbody.
Safety chains
Always use safety chains when you tow a trailer. Leave enough slack to allow the
trailer to turn corners easily, but do not allow the chains to drag on the ground.
Trailer brakes
If you are thinking of getting a trailer that has brakes, be sure they are electronically
actuated. Do not attempt to tap into your vehicle's hydraulic system. No matter how
successful it may seem, any attempt to attach trailer brakes to your vehicle's
hydraulic system will lower braking effectiveness and create a potential hazard.
Driving
Additional towing equipment
Many states and provinces/territories require special outside mirrors when towing a
trailer. Even if mirrors are not required in your locale, you should install special
mirrors if visibility is restricted in any way.
432
>Towing Equipment and Accessories
Make sure that all equipment is properly installed and
maintained, and that it meets federal, state, province/
territory, and local regulations.
Consult your trailer maker for proper installation and
setup of the equipment.
Improper installation and setup can affect the
handling, stability, and braking performance of your
vehicle.
Consult your trailer sales or rental agency if any other
items are recommended or required for your towing
situation.
The lighting and wiring of trailers can vary by type
and brand. If a connector is required, it should only
be installed by a qualified technician.
Trailer packages and products:
· Ball mount, hitch plug, hitch pin etc.
· Wiring harness kit
· Trailer hitch kit

Things You Need To Know Before Towing a Trailer
. Have the trailer properly serviced and keep it in good condition.
. Make sure that all the weights and load in the vehicle and trailer are within limits.
>Towing Load Limits P. 431
· Securely attach the hitch, safety chains, and other necessary parts to the trailer.
. Securely store all the items in and on the trailer so that they do not shift while
driving.
. Check if the lights and brakes on the trailer are working properly.
. Check the pressure of the trailer tires, including the spare.
. Turn off the Auto Idle Stop system using the Auto Idle Stop OFF button. The
trailer weight can affect your vehicle's brake effectiveness if Auto Idle Stop is
activated on a hill while towing a trailer.

>Driving Safely with a Trailer
Operating speed when towing a trailer must not
exceed 62 mph (100 km/h).
Parking
In addition to the normal precautions, place wheel
chocks at each of the trailer's tires.
When towing a trailer, we recommend that you carry
a full-size spare wheel and tire for both your vehicle
and trailer. If you use the compact spare tire that
came with your vehicle, it could adversely affect
vehicle driving stability.
Remember to unhitch the trailer before changing a
flat tire. Ask the trailer sales or rental agency where
and how to store the trailer's spare tire.
>Towing Speeds and Shift Position
When towing a fixed-sided trailer (e.g., camper), do
not exceed 55 mph (88 km/h). At higher speeds, the
trailer may sway or affect vehicle handling.

Off-Highway Driving Guidelines
General Information
Your vehicle has been designed primarily for use on pavement, however, its higher
ground clearance allows you to occasionally travel on unpaved roads. It is not
designed for trail-blazing, or other challenging off-highway activities.
If you decide to drive on unpaved roads, you will find that it requires somewhat
different driving skills and that your vehicle will handle somewhat differently than it
does on pavement. Pay attention to the precautions and tips in this section, and get
acquainted with your vehicle before leaving the pavement.
Important Safety Precautions
To avoid loss of control or rollover, be sure to follow all precautions and
recommendations:
· Be sure to store cargo properly and do not exceed your cargo load limits.
Maximum Load Limit P. 429
· Whenever you drive, make sure you and your passengers always wear seat belts.
. Keep your speed low, and never go faster than the conditions allow.
. It's up to you to continually assess the situation and drive within the limits.
>Off-Highway Driving Guidelines
WARNING
Improperly operating this vehicle on or off-
pavement can cause a crash or rollover in
which you and your passengers could be
seriously injured or killed.
· Follow all instructions and guidelines in
this owner's manual.
. Keep your speed low, and don't drive
faster than conditions permit.
Failure to operate your vehicle correctly might result
in a crash or a rollover.
> Important Handling Information P. 40
> Precautions While Driving P. 446
Driving
437
>>Off-Highway Driving Guidelines Avoiding Trouble
Avoiding Trouble
. Check Out Your Vehicle before you leave the pavement and make sure that all
scheduled maintenance has been completed. Pay special attention to the
condition of the tires, and check the tire pressures.
· Remember the route you choose presents limits (too steep or bumpy), you have
limits (driving skill and comfort), and your vehicle has limits (traction, stability, and
power). Failing to recognize these limits will likely put you and your passengers in
a hazardous situation.
Driving
· Accelerating and Braking should be done slowly and gradually. Trying to start
or stop too fast can cause a loss of traction and you could lose control.
. Avoiding Obstacles and Debris in the road reduces the likelihood of a rollover
or damage to your suspension or other components.
· Driving on Slopes increases your risk of a rollover, particularly if you attempt to
drive across a slope that is too steep. Going straight up or down a slope is usually
the safest. If you can't clearly see all conditions or obstacles on a slope, walk it
before you drive it. If there is any doubt whether you can safely pass, don't try it.
Find another route. If you get stuck when climbing, do not try to turn around.
Back down slowly following the same route you took up the hill.
· Crossing a Stream - Avoid driving through deep water. If you encounter water
in your route (a small stream or large puddle, for example), evaluate it carefully
before going ahead. Make sure it is shallow, flowing slowly, and has firm ground
underneath. If you are not sure of the depth or the ground, turn around and find
another route. Driving through deep water can also damage your vehicle. The
water can get into the transmission and differential, diluting the lubricant and
causing an eventual failure. It can also wash the grease out of the wheel bearings.
. If You Get Stuck, carefully go in the direction that you think will get you
unstuck. Do not spin the tires as this will only make things worse and could
damage the transmission. If you are unable to free yourself, your vehicle will need
to be towed. Front and rear tow hooks are provided for this purpose.

Precautions While Driving
Driving Guidelines for Your Utility Vehicle
Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.
To prevent rollovers or loss of control:
· Take corners at slower speeds than you would with a passenger vehicle.
· Avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers whenever possible.
. Do not modify your vehicle in any way that you would raise the center of gravity.
· Do not carry heavy cargo on the roof.
Never carry more than 165 lbs (75 kg) of cargo on the roof rack (Honda accessory).
In Rain
Avoid driving in deep water and on flooded roads. This can damage the engine or
driveline, or cause electrical component failure.
Driving
Other Precautions
If there is a strong impact with something under the vehicle, stop in a safe location.
Check the underside of the vehicle for damage or any fluid leaks.
446
Precautions While Driving
NOTICE
Do not operate the shift lever while pressing the
accelerator pedal. You could damage the
transmission.
NOTICE
If you repeatedly turn the steering wheel at an
extremely low speed, or hold the steering wheel in
the full left or right position for a while, the electric
power steering (EPS) system heats up. The system
goes into a protective mode, and limits its
performance. The steering wheel becomes harder
and harder to operate. Once the system cools down,
the EPS system is restored.
Repeated operation under these conditions can
eventually damage the system.
If the power mode is set to ACCESSORY while
driving, the engine will shut down and all steering
and brake power assist functions will stop, making it
difficult to control the vehicle.
Do not select N while driving as you will lose engine
braking (and acceleration) performance.
During the first 600 miles (1,000 km) of operation,
avoid sudden acceleration or full throttle operation so
as not to damage the engine or powertrain.
Avoid hard braking for the first 200 miles (300 km)
after purchasing your new vehicle or replacing the
brake pads or rotors, to allow for proper break-in.

When Driving Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required Federal Explanation
U.S. models
Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required
Federal Explanation
Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked
monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure
recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard
or tire inflation pressure label.
(If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated
on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should
determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with
a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low
tire pressure telltale
Driving
when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.
Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you
should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate
them to the proper pressure.
Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to
overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces
fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's
handling and stopping ability.
470
When Driving Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required Federal Explanation
Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire
maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain
correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the
level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction
indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire
pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the
telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain
continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon
subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.
When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may
not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended.
Driving
TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including
the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the
vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or
more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the
replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to
continue to function properly.

When Driving Blind Spot Information System *
Blind Spot Information System*
When the system detects vehicles approaching from behind in adjacent lanes, the
appropriate indicator comes on, providing assistance when you change lanes.
How the System works
The system activates when your vehicle is moving forward at about 20 mph (32 km/h)
or above.
Radar Sensors : underneath
the rear bumper corners
: Alert Zone 1
: Alert Zone 2
A
Driving
B
C
Alert zone range
A: Approx. 1.6 ~ 10 feet (0.5 ~ 3 meters) from vehicle side.
B: Approx. 10 feet (3 meters) from rear bumper.
C: Approx. 10 ~ 82 feet (3 ~ 25 meters) behind from rear bumper. (The faster the
approaching vehicle, the further away it will be detected.)
The initially set alert zone is alert zone 1. Over time, after the vehicle has been driven
on straight roads with traffic and roadside objects, the system will adapt and expand
the alert zone (alert zone 1 and 2).
472
>Blind Spot Information System
Important Safety Reminder
Like all assistance systems, the Blind Spot Information
System has limitations. Always look in your mirrors,
to either side of your vehicle, and behind you for
other vehicles before changing lanes. Overreliance on
the Blind Spot Information System may result in a
collision.
Have your vehicle checked by a dealer in the
following situations:
. The rear bumper or area around the radar sensors
is strongly impacted.
· The indicator does not come on even if a vehicle in
the alert zone should have been detected.
· The rear bumper or any system components need
to be repaired.
If the rear bumper or any system components are
repaired, the system will revert to alert zone 1 only
until it is able to adapt and expand to alert zone 1
and 2.
For proper Blind Spot Information System operation:
· Always keep the rear bumper and area around the
radar sensors clean.
· Do not cover the rear bumper corner area with
labels or stickers of any kind.

Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™)
The system can assist you when it determines there is a possibility of your vehicle
colliding with a vehicle (including motorcycles) ahead from behind, an oncoming
vehicle in front, a pedestrian, or someone riding a bicycle (moving bicycle). The
CMBS™M is designed to alert you when the potential for a collision is determined, as
well as assist in reducing speed, avoiding collisions, and reducing collision severity.
>Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™)
Important Safety Reminder
The CMBS™ is designed to reduce the severity of an
unavoidable collision. It does not prevent collisions
nor stop the vehicle automatically. It is still your
responsibility to operate the brake pedal and steering
wheel appropriately according to the driving
conditions.
The CMBS™M may not activate or may not detect a
vehicle in front of your vehicle under certain

Driving
480
The system starts monitoring the roadway ahead when your vehicle speed is about
3 mph (5 km/h) or above and will search for a vehicle, pedestrian, or moving bicycle
in front of you.
The CMBS™ activates when:
· The speed difference between your vehicle and a vehicle, pedestrian, or moving
bicycle detected in front of you becomes about 3 mph (5 km/h) and over with a
chance of a collision.
· Your vehicle drives at about 18 mph (30 km/h) or less and there is a chance of in
frontal collision with a detected oncoming vehicle when you turn left at an
intersection.
· Your vehicle speed is about 62 mph (100 km/h) or less and the system determines
there is a chance of a collision with:
- An oncoming or stationary vehicle detected in front of you.
- A pedestrian or moving bicycle detected in front of you.
The CMBS™ will be canceled when your vehicle stops or the system determines
there no longer is the potential for a collision.
The CMBS™ may also be canceled when a driver operates the steering wheel and
the brake or accelerator pedal to avoid a collision.

Honda Sensing® Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low Speed Follow
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low Speed Follow
Helps maintain a constant vehicle speed and a set following-interval behind a vehicle
detected ahead of yours and, if the detected vehicle comes to a stop, can decelerate
and stop your vehicle, without you having to keep your foot on the brake or the
accelerator.
When ACC with Low Speed Follow slows your vehicle by applying the brakes, your
vehicle's brake lights will illuminate.
When to use
A front sensor
camera is
located behind
the rearview
mirror.
The radar sensor is behind
the Honda emblem on the
front grille.
Vehicle speed for ACC with Low Speed Follow: A vehicle is detected ahead
within ACC with Low Speed Follow range - ACC with Low Speed Follow
operates at speeds up to 90 mph (145 km/h).
No vehicle is detected within ACC with Low Speed Follow range - ACC with
Low Speed Follow operates at the speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) or above.

Honda Sensing® Traffic Jam Assist
Traffic Jam Assist
The Traffic Jam Assist system uses a camera mounted to the upper portion of the
windshield to detect and monitor left and right white (or yellow) traffic lane lines.
Based on inputs from the camera, the system can apply steering torque to keep your
vehicle in the center of the detected lane.
How Traffic Jam Assist works
When you are in heavy traffic and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) is active, the
Traffic Jam Assist system, upon detecting the traffic lane lines, will apply steering
torque to help keep your vehicle in the center of the lane.
Front Sensor Camera
Detects left and right white
(or yellow) traffic lane lines
When you use the turn signal to indicate a lane change, Traffic Jam Assist is
temporarily deactivated. It is reactivated once the vehicle is traveling in the
center of the lane and the system has detected the traffic lane lines.
When the driver takes full control of the steering, the steering assist function is
temporarily canceled.
The torque applied to the steering may not be noticeable when the driver has full
control of the steering, or when the surface of the road is rough or uneven.
>Traffic Jam Assist
Important Safety Reminders
Traffic Jam Assist is for your convenience only. It is
not an autonomous driving system and always
requires driver attention and control. The system
does not work if you take your hands off the steering
wheel or fail to steer the vehicle.
Traffic Jam Assist is convenient when it is used on
expressways or freeways.
You can read about handling information for the
camera equipped with this system.
Front Sensor Camera P. 552
The Traffic Jam Assist only alerts you when lane drift
is detected without a turn signal in use. The Traffic
Jam Assist may not detect all lane markings or lane
departures; accuracy will vary based on weather,
speed, and lane marker condition.
It is always your responsibility to safely operate the
vehicle and avoid collisions.

Braking Brake System
Foot Brake
Your vehicle is equipped with disc brakes at all four wheels. The brake assist system
increases the stopping force when you depress the brake pedal hard in an
emergency situation. The anti-lock brake system (ABS) helps you retain steering
control when braking very hard.
> Brake Assist System P. 565
Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) P. 564
Driving
560
>Foot Brake
Check the brakes after driving through deep water,
or if there is a buildup of road surface water. If
necessary, dry the brakes by lightly depressing the
pedal several times.
If you hear a continuous metallic friction sound when
applying the brakes, this is caused by the brake wear
indicator rubbing on the brake rotor and indicates
that the brake pads need to be replaced. Have the
vehicle checked by a dealer. If you hear only an
occasional squeak or squeal when you initially apply
the brake pedal, this may be normal and caused by
high frequency vibration of the brake pads against
the rotating brake disc.
Constantly using the brake pedal while going down a
long hill builds up heat, which reduces the brake
effectiveness. Apply engine braking by taking your
foot off the accelerator pedal and downshifting to a
speed position.
Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal while
driving, as it will lightly apply the brakes and cause
them to lose effectiveness over time and reduce pad
life. It will also confuse drivers behind you.
Whenever the brakes are activated by CMBS™ or
another system that automatically controls braking,
the brake pedal is depressed and released in
accordance with braking function.

Braking Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
ABS
Helps prevent the wheels from locking up, and helps you retain steering control by
pumping the brakes rapidly, much faster than you can.
The electronic brake distribution (EBD) system, which is part of the ABS, also
balances the front-to-rear braking distribution according to vehicle loading.
You should never pump the brake pedal. Let the ABS work for you by always
keeping firm, steady pressure on the brake pedal. This is sometimes referred to as
"stomp and steer."
ABS operation
The brake pedal may pulsate slightly when the ABS is working. Depress the brake
pedal and keep holding the pedal firmly down. On dry pavement, you will need to
press on the brake pedal very hard before the ABS activates. However, you may feel
the ABS activate immediately if you are trying to stop on snow or ice.
Driving
ABS may activate when you depress the brake pedal when driving on:
· Wet or snow covered roads.
· Roads paved with stone.
· Roads with uneven surfaces, such as potholes, cracks, manholes, etc.
When the vehicle speed goes under 6 mph (10 km/h), the ABS stops.
564
»Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
NOTICE
The ABS may not function correctly if you use a tire of
the incorrect size or type.
If the ABS indicator comes on while driving, there
may be a problem with the system.
While normal braking will not be affected, there is a
possibility that the ABS will not be operating. Have
your vehicle checked by a dealer immediately.
The ABS is not designed for the purpose of reducing
the time or distance it takes for a vehicle to stop: It is
designed to limit brake lockup which can lead to
skidding and loss of steering control.
In the following cases, your vehicle may need more
distance to stop than a vehicle without the ABS:
· You are driving on rough or uneven road surfaces,
such as gravel or snow.
. The tires are equipped with tire chains.
The following may be observed with the ABS system:
· Motor sounds coming from the engine
compartment when the brakes are applied, or
when system checks are being performed after the
engine has been started and while the vehicle
accelerates.
· Brake pedal and/or the vehicle body vibration when
ABS activates.
These vibrations and sounds are normal to ABS
systems and are no cause for concern.

>When Stopped
In extremely cold temperatures, the parking brake
may freeze up if applied. If such temperatures are
expected, do not apply the parking brake but, if
parking on a slope, either turn the front wheels so
they will contact the curb if the vehicle rolls down the
slope or block the wheels to keep the vehicle from
moving. If you do not take either precaution, the
vehicle may roll unexpectedly, leading to a crash.
After shutting off the engine, you may hear certain
noises coming from the vehicle. Here's the lowdown:
· Noise from Under Vehicle: This noise is caused by
the vacuum pump inside the fuel evaporation
leakage check module (ELCM).
Depending on conditions, the pump will come on
for about 15 minutes about 5 to 10 hours after

>How to Refuel
A WARNING
Gasoline is highly flammable and explosive.
You can be burned or seriously injured
when handling fuel.
· Stop the engine, and keep heat, sparks,
and flames away.
· Handle fuel only outdoors.
· Wipe up spills immediately.
The fuel filler opening is designed to accept only
service station filler nozzles for refueling. Use of
smaller diameter tubes (e.g., those used to siphon
fuel for other uses) or other non-service station
devices can damage the area in and around the filler
opening.
Refueling How to Refuel
6. Place the end of the filler nozzle on the
lower part of filler opening, then insert it
slowly and fully.
Make sure that the end of the filler
nozzle goes down along with the filler
pipe.
Keep the filler nozzle level.
>When the tank is full, the filler nozzle will
click off automatically.
If you do not fill up the tank to full,
always add a minimum of 1.3 US gal (5 L)
of fuel.
After filling, wait about five seconds
before removing the filler nozzle.
7. Shut the fuel fill door by hand.
How to Refuel
Use the lock tab or the master door lock switch to
unlock the fuel fill door.
The vehicle doors and fuel fill door automatically
relock if the remote unlock function is used. This can
be deactivated by briefly opening then closing the
driver's door.
If the filler nozzle keeps turning off when the tank is
not full, there may be a problem with the pump's fuel
vapor recovery system. Try filling at another pump. If
this does not fix the problem, consult a dealer.
The filler nozzle automatically stops to leave space in
the fuel tank so that fuel does not overflow as a result
of changes in air temperature.
Do not continue to add fuel after the filler nozzle has
automatically stopped. Additional fuel can exceed
the full tank capacity.
Driving
If you repeatedly fill the tank with less than the
specified minimum amount of fuel, the malfunction
indicator lamp may come on. If this happens, have
your vehicle checked by a dealer.
If you have to refuel your vehicle from a portable
container, use the funnel provided with your vehicle.

Emissions
Achieving fuel economy and reducing CO2 emissions is dependent on several
factors, including driving conditions, load weight, idling time, driving habits, and
vehicle condition. Depending on these and other factors, you may not achieve the
rated fuel economy of this vehicle.
Maintenance and Fuel Economy
You can optimize your fuel economy with proper maintenance of your vehicle.
Always maintain your vehicle in accordance with the messages displayed on the
driver information interface.
. Use engine oil with the viscosity recommended.

Turbo Engine Vehicle
Handling Precautions
The turbocharger is a high-precision device to obtain greater horsepower by
delivering a large volume of compressed air into the engine using a turbine driven by
the engine's exhaust gas pressure.
· When the engine is cold just after starting, avoid revving the engine or sudden
acceleration.
· Always replace the engine oil and engine oil filter according to the Maintenance
Minder™. The turbine rotates at very high speeds over 100,000 rpm and its
temperature reaches over 1,292ºF (700℃). It is lubricated and cooled by engine
oil. If you fail to replace the engine oil and filter at the scheduled distance or
interval, deteriorated engine oil may cause failure such as sticking and abnormal
noise of the turbine bearing.
>Turbo Engine Vehicle
The scheduled maintenance intervals for replacing
the filter is indicated on the driver information
interface. Follow the information on replacement
timing.

Heat from the engine and exhaust can ignite them, causing a fire.
· To clean parts, use a commercially available degreaser or parts cleaner, not
gasoline.
· Wear eye protection and protective clothing when working with the battery or
compressed air.
· Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, which is poisonous and can kill you.
Only operate the engine if there is sufficient ventilation.
Vehicle Safety
· The vehicle must be in a stationary condition.
Make sure your vehicle is parked on level ground, the parking brake is set, and
the engine is off.
· Be aware that hot parts can burn you.
Make sure to let the engine and exhaust system cool thoroughly before
touching vehicle parts.
· Be aware that moving parts can injure you.
Do not start the engine unless instructed, and keep your hands and limbs away
from moving parts.
Do not open the hood while the Auto Idle Stop function is activated.

A WARNING
Removing the radiator cap while the
engine is hot can cause the coolant to spray
out, seriously scalding you.
Always let the engine and radiator cool
down before removing the radiator cap.
NOTICE
Genuine Honda engine coolant is a 50/50 mixture of
antifreeze and water that can withstand freezing at
temperatures as low as about -31ºF (-35℃). If your
vehicle is consistently subjected to temperatures
below this, the concentration of antifreeze in the
coolant should be increased. Consult a dealer for
details.
If Honda antifreeze/coolant is not available, you may
use another major brand of non-silicate coolant as a
temporary replacement. Check that it is a high quality
coolant recommended for aluminum engines.
Continued use of any non-Honda coolant can result
in corrosion, causing the cooling system to
malfunction or fail. Have the cooling system flushed
and refilled with Honda antifreeze/coolant as soon as
possible.

Checking and Maintaining Tires
Checking Tires
To safely operate your vehicle, your tires must be of the proper type and size, in
good condition with adequate tread, and properly inflated.
Inflation guidelines
Properly inflated tires provide the best combination of handling, tread life, and comfort.
Refer to the driver's doorjamb label or specifications page for the specified pressure.
Underinflated tires wear unevenly, adversely affect handling and fuel economy, and
are more likely to fail from overheating.
Overinflated tires make your vehicle ride harshly, are more prone to road hazards,
and wear unevenly.
Every day before you drive, look at each of the tires. If one looks lower than the
others, check the pressure with a tire gauge.
At least once a month or before long trips, use a gauge to measure the pressure in
all tires, including the spare. Even tires in good condition can lose 1-2 psi
(10-20 kPa, 0.1-0.2 kgf/cm2) per month.
Inspection guidelines
Every time you check inflation, also examine the tires and valve stems.
Look for:
. Bumps or bulges on the side or in the tread. Replace the tire if you find any cuts,
splits, or cracks in the side of the tire. Replace it if you see fabric or cord.
· Remove any foreign objects and inspect for air leaks.
· Uneven tread wear. Have a dealer check the wheel alignment.
· Excessive tread wear.
>Wear Indicators P. 622
· Cracks or other damage around valve stem.
Checking Tires
WARNING
Using tires that are excessively worn or
improperly inflated can cause a crash in
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.
Follow all instructions in this owner's
manual regarding tire inflation and
maintenance.
Measure the air pressure when tires are cold. This
means the vehicle has been parked for at least three
hours, or driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km). If
necessary, add or release air until the specified
pressure is reached.
If checked when hot, tire pressure can be as much as
4-6 psi (30-40 kPa, 0.3-0.4 kgf/cm2) higher than if
checked when cold.
U.S. models
Maintenance
Whenever tire pressure is adjusted, you must
calibrate the TPMS.
> Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
P. 465
Have a dealer check the tires if you feel a consistent
vibration while driving. New tires and any that have
been removed and reinstalled should be properly
balanced.

Checking and Maintaining Tires DOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)
DOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)
The tires on your vehicle meet all U.S. Federal Safety
Requirements. All tires are also graded for treadwear, traction,
and temperature performance according to Department of
Transportation (DOT) standards. The following explains these
gradings.
Uniform Tire Quality Grading
Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall
between tread shoulder and maximum section width.
Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear
rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a
specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150
would wear one and one-half (1 1/2) times as well on the
government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance
of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however,
and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in
driving habits, service practices and differences in road
characteristics and climate.
Maintenance
620
>Uniform Tire Quality Grading
For example:
Treadwear 200
Traction AA
Temperature A
All passenger car tires must conform
to Federal Safety Requirements in
addition to these grades.
>Checking and Maintaining Tires DOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)
Traction
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C.
Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement
as measured under controlled conditions on specified
government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked
C may have poor traction performance.
Temperature
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C,
representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its
ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions
on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high
temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and
reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire
failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which
all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum
required by law.
>
1Traction
Warning: The traction grade
assigned to this tire is based on
straight-ahead braking traction tests,
and does not include acceleration,
cornering, hydroplaning, or peak
traction characteristics.
>Temperature
Warning: The temperature grade for
this tire is established for a tire that is
properly inflated and not
overloaded. Excessive speed,
underinflation, or excessive loading,
either separately or in combination,
can cause heat buildup and possible
tire failure.

621
Checking and Maintaining Tires Wear Indicators
Wear Indicators
Example of a Wear
Indicator mark
The groove where the wear indicator is
located is about 1/16 inch (about 1.6 mm)
shallower than elsewhere on the tire. If the
tread has worn so that the indicator is
exposed, replace the tire.
Worn out tires have poor traction on wet
roads.
Tire Service Life
The life of your tires is dependent on many factors, including driving habits, road
conditions, vehicle loading, inflation pressure, maintenance history, speed, and
environmental conditions (even when the tires are not in use).
In addition to regular inspections and inflation pressure maintenance, it is
recommended that you have annual inspections performed once the tires reach five
years old. All tires, including the spare, should be removed from service after 10
years from the date of manufacture, regardless of their condition or state of wear.

Checking and Maintaining Tires Tire and Wheel Replacement
Tire and Wheel Replacement
Replace your tires with radials of the same size, load range, speed rating, and
maximum cold tire pressure rating (as shown on the tire's sidewall). Using tires of a
different size or construction can cause certain vehicle systems such as the ABS and
Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) system to work incorrectly.
It is best to replace all four tires at the same time. If that isn't possible, replace the
front or rear tires in pairs.
Make sure that the wheel's specifications match those of the original wheels.

Changing a Flat Tire
Follow compact spare precautions:
Periodically check the tire pressure of the compact
spare. It should be set to the specified pressure.
Specified Pressure: 60 psi (420 kPa, 4.2 kgf/cm2)
When driving with the compact spare tire, keep the
vehicle speed under 50 mph (80 km/h). Replace with
a full-size tire as soon as possible.
The compact spare tire and wheel in your vehicle are
specifically for this model. Do not use them with
another vehicle. Do not use another type of compact
spare tire or wheel with your vehicle.
Do not mount tire chains on a compact spare tire.
If a chain-mounted front tire goes flat, remove one of
the full-size rear tires and replace it with the compact
spare tire. Remove the flat front tire and replace it
with the full-size tire that was removed from the rear.
Mount the tire chains on the front tire.

Emissions Testing
Testing of Readiness Codes
Your vehicle has readiness code as part of the onboard self diagnostic system.
Some states use these codes for testing to verify whether your vehicle's emissions
components are working properly.
The codes may not be read properly if testing is performed just after the battery has
gone dead or been disconnected.
To check if they are set, set the power mode to ON, without starting the engine. The
malfunction indicator lamp will come on for several seconds. If it then goes off, the
readiness codes are set. If it blinks five times, the readiness codes are not set.
If you are required to have your vehicle tested before the readiness codes are ready,
prepare the vehicle for retesting by doing the following:
1. Fill the gas tank to approximately 3/4 full.
2. Park the vehicle and leave the engine off for 6 hours or more.
3. Make sure the ambient temperature is between 40ºF and 95ºF (4℃ and 35℃).
4. Start the engine without touching the accelerator pedal, and let it idle for 20
seconds.
5. Keep the vehicle in [P]. Increase the engine speed to 2,000 rpm, and hold it there
for about 3 minutes.
6. Let the engine idle with your foot off the accelerator for 20 seconds.
>Testing of Readiness Codes
The readiness codes are erased when the battery is
disconnected, and set again only after several days of
driving under a variety of conditions.
If a testing facility determines that the readiness
codes are not set, you may be requested to return at
a later date to complete the test.
If the testing facility determines the readiness codes
are still not set, see a dealer.

Emissions Testing Testing of Readiness Codes
7. Select a nearby, lightly traveled major highway where you can maintain a speed
of 50 to 60 mph (80 to 97 km/h) for at least 20 minutes. Drive on the highway in
D . Do not use cruise control. When traffic allows, drive for 90 seconds without
moving the accelerator pedal. (Vehicle speed may vary slightly; this is okay.) If you
cannot do this for a continuous 90 seconds because of traffic conditions, drive for
at least 30 seconds, then repeat it two more times (for a total of 90 seconds).
8. Drive in city or suburban traffic for at least 10 minutes. When traffic conditions
allow, let the vehicle coast for several seconds without using the accelerator pedal
or the brake pedal.
9. Park the vehicle and leave the engine off for 30 minutes.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty - covers your new vehicle, except for the
emissions control systems and accessories, against defects in materials and
workmanship.
Emissions Control Systems Defects Warranty and Emissions Performance
Warranty - these two warranties cover your vehicle's emissions control systems.
Time, mileage, and coverage are conditional. Please read your warranty booklet for
exact information.
Seat Belt Limited Warranty - a seat belt that fails to function properly is covered
by a limited warranty. Please read your warranty booklet for details.
Rust Perforation Limited Warranty - all exterior body panels are covered against
rusting from the inside out for the specified time period, regardless of mileage.
Accessory Limited Warranty - Honda accessories are covered under this
warranty. Time and mileage limits depend on the type of accessory and other
factors. Please read your warranty booklet for details.
Information
Replacement Parts Limited Warranty - covers all Honda replacement parts
against defects in materials and workmanship.
Continued
683
Warranty Coverages
Replacement Battery Limited Warranty - provides prorated coverage for a
replacement battery purchased from your dealer.
Replacement Muffler Lifetime Limited Warranty - provides coverage for as
long as the purchaser of the muffler owns the vehicle.
Restrictions and exclusions apply to all these warranties. Please read the Honda
warranty information booklet that came with your vehicle for precise information on
warranty coverages. Your vehicle's original tires are covered by their manufacturer.
Tire warranty information is in a separate booklet.
Statement on Warranty Coverage for Aftermarket and Recycled Parts
The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. s.2301 et seq., makes it illegal for
motor vehicle manufacturers to void a motor vehicle warranty or deny warranty
coverage solely because an aftermarket or recycled part has been used to repair the
vehicle or someone other than the authorized service provider performed service on
the vehicle. This provision does not apply to a new motor vehicle purchased solely
for commercial or industrial use.
Information
684
Warranty Coverages
Under federal law, a manufacturer may deny warranty coverage and charge for
repairs to a vehicle if it is discovered that an aftermarket or recycled part installed on
the vehicle is defective or was installed incorrectly and caused damage to another
part of the vehicle otherwise covered under warranty. The Federal Trade
Commission requires that a manufacturer demonstrate that an aftermarket or
recycled part or service performed by a person other than an authorized service
provider caused damage to another part of the vehicle otherwise covered under
warranty before denying warranty coverage. Additionally, federal law allows a
manufacturer to void a motor vehicle warranty or deny warranty coverage if the
manufacturer provides the article or service to consumers free of charge under the
warranty or the manufacturer has secured a waiver from the Federal Trade
Commission.
Canadian Owners
Please refer to the warranty manual that came with your vehicle.
